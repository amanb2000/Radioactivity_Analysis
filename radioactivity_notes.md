# Radioactivity in Air -- Notes

Lab 2 for our group of three. Due March 11. 

## Introduction	

Measuring radioactivity of the air from outside. Depends on weather, filtration, sometimes industrial sources.

### Result of Experiment

* *Beta Decay Curves* are the final result.
* Intermediate result (actual measurement values) are *radioactivity of dust particles*. 
* Particles get attached to filter paper and decay during long filter time.

Final goal: measure concentration of radon via **

### Equipment

1. Geiger-Mueller Tube: Radiation measurement.
	* Tube has ionized gas, any ionizing radiation causes a negative charge accumulation.
2. Picker-Scaler: Power supply.

### Steps (High-Level)

Session 1: 
* Measuring Cesium-137 source. 
* Take 'plateau curve' to figure out the operating voltage.
 Measuring background radiation.

Session 2:
* Air sampler => decay curve
* Run air sampler for 1-2 hours. 
* 

Determining Operating Voltage: 
* 'measure and plot a curve of number of counts per standard time interval versus high voltage.' (Cs-137)
* Operating voltage should be where counter sensitivity is *independent* from high voltage.
* .
